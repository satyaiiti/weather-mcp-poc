# 🌤️ Weather Agent POC using OpenAI + MCP Tooling

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **LLM agent POC** using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** pattern. It answers **weather-related queries** using OpenAI's function-calling capabilities, wrapped in a tool abstraction.

## 🔧 Features

- 🎯 Focused LLM agent: answers only **weather-specific** questions
- 🧠 Built using **OpenAI GPT-4** via the new `openai>=1.0.0` SDK
- 🔌 Modular agent + tool architecture using **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** concept
- ✅ Environment-safe setup (API key is read from `.env`)
- ⚙️ Designed to be production-ready and extendable
